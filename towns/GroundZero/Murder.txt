Murder is wrong because it creates objective negetivity. Pain is objectively negetive. Sure, some people enjoy pain.. to a certain extent, but normally pain is seen as a negetive thing, and the body itself creates pain to notify the brain of something negetive. Emotional depression and negetive feelings are objective as well. No one likes to be upset or depressed. By definition, depression and all emotions included with it are negetive. Depression can NOT be positive, because if it were, it would not be depression. Same thing with pain. Maybe to make it more clear, instead of calling it "objective" (Since, pain is in essense subjective) we can call it universally negetive to all/most living beings who can feel pain.

No one truthfully wants to die, and a person's death can create negetive emotions in those close to said person. Thus, if you murder person x, you are creating things that are objectively wrong, such as negetive emotional distress on their loved ones, the pain of the person murdered assuming it wasn't an instant death, and the objective negetivity of taking a life(Since, humans are wired to want to survive). Therefore, murder is wrong.

This can also show why thievery or abuse is wrong as well. It could also help identify HOW wrong something is, depending on the intensity/amount of negetivity it creates. IE: Killing two people would be worse than killing one person. Torturing one person would be worse than killing two people, etc. This could also make other things "wrong", that we wouldn't normally consider wrong. However, some things would have such minor negetive outcomes to the point where they are negligible. Such as a small lie.

There are still problems with this, though. Such as self-defence. What if the person you killed out of self defence caused more negetivity than if you would have let him kill you instead?
